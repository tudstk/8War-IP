# 8War

## Overview

8War is a ```2D game``` in which two players take part (```PvP or Player vs. Bot```) and your purpose is to eliminate as many soldiers as possible from the enemy army (represented by pieces).

This game was made in ```C++``` using ```graphics.h``` library.

## Prerequisites
- ```Windows 8/10/11```
- ```graphics.h```
- ```An IDE```

## Rules

- At the start of the game, both armies have 8 soldiers placed on a chess-like table (8x8, black & colored squares). The soldiers are placed on the colored squares.
- Soldiers can only move diagonally.
- A soldier is eliminated only if he can't move anywhere.
- ```PvP mode```: after the timer ends (120s), the player who has more soldiers on the table wins, if both players have the same number of soldiers left on the table, it's declared Draw.
- ```Player vs. Bot```: you can choose two difficulties: easy and hard. There is no timer for this mode. You can win by eliminating every soldier from the enemy team
- If player1 has only one soldier on the table and player2 has 3 or more, player2 is automatically declared the winner.
